## 🚀 Quick Start (3 Steps)

### **Step 1: Install Dependencies**

```bash
cd backend
npm install axios multer
```

### **Step 2: Update Server Routes**

Edit `backend/src/server.js` and add this line after the other route imports (around line 26):

```javascript
const aiRoutesAdvanced = require('./routes/aiRoutesAdvanced');
```

Then add this route (around line 85, after other routes):

```javascript
app.use('/api/ai', aiRoutesAdvanced);  // This replaces or supplements the old ai route
```

**Full route section should look like:**
```javascript
// API Routes
app.use('/api/auth', authRoutes);
app.use('/api/users', userRoutes);
app.use('/api/sales', salesRoutes);
app.use('/api/expenses', expensesRoutes);
app.use('/api/inventory', inventoryRoutes);
app.use('/api/customers', customersRoutes);
app.use('/api/ai', aiRoutesAdvanced);  // ✅ UPDATED
app.use('/api/ai-insights', aiInsightsRoutes);
app.use('/api/messages', messagesRoutes);
app.use('/api/profit-analytics', profitAnalyticsRoutes);
```

### **Step 3: Configure Environment (Optional)**

**Option A: Run WITHOUT API keys (FREE)**
- Everything works in fallback mode
- Smart keyword-based responses
- Uses your real business data
- No setup needed!

**Option B: Add OpenAI for Advanced AI ($5 free credits)**

1. Get API key: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Edit `backend/.env`:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
   ```
3. Restart backend

That's it! 🎉

## 🧪 Testing Your Example Scenario

Let's test your exact requirements:

### **Scenario:**
```
Add 100 items @ ₹200 cost
Sell 5 items @ ₹300 each  
Sales expense ₹50
```

### **Step-by-Step Test:**

**1. Start servers:**
```bash
# Terminal 1
cd backend
npm start

# Terminal 2
cd frontend
npm start
```

**2. Login:**
- Go to http://localhost:3000
- Login or register

**3. Add Inventory:**
```
Sidebar → Inventory → Add Item
Item Name: Smartphone
Stock Quantity: 100
Price Per Unit (Cost): 200
Click "Add Item"
```

**4. Create Sale:**
```
Sidebar → Sales → New Sale
Item Name: Smartphone
Quantity: 5
Price Per Unit (Selling): 300
Payment Method: Cash
Click "Create Sale"
```

**5. Add Expense:**
```
Sidebar → Expenses → Add Expense
Amount: 50
Description: Marketing Campaign
Category: Marketing
✅ CHECK: "Sales-Related Expense"
Click "Add Expense"
```

**6. Verify Results:**

**Dashboard should show:**
- Basic Profit: ₹1,450 (or Net Profit if using profit API)
- Total Expenses: ₹50
- Inventory Value: ₹19,000

**Sales Page:**
| Revenue | COGS | Profit |
|---------|------|--------|
| ₹1,500  | ₹1,000 | ₹500 |

**Inventory:**
- Quantity: **95** (decreased from 100!) ✅
- Value: **₹19,000**

**Analytics:**
- Revenue: ₹1,500
- COGS: ₹1,000
- Gross Profit: ₹500
- Net Profit: ₹450 (₹500 - ₹50)
- Remaining Inventory: ₹19,000

---

## 🤖 Test AI Features

### **Test 1: Smart Chat (Works WITHOUT API key)**

Go to **AI Assistant** page and type:

```
"Show me my inventory status"
```

**Expected Response:**
```
📦 Inventory Overview

• Total Items: 1
• Low Stock Items: 0

✅ All items are well stocked.

Suggestions:
- Show inventory list
- Add new item
- Update stock
```

---

### **Test 2: Business Analysis**

Type:
```
"Analyze my business performance"
```

**Without OpenAI (FREE):**
```
✅ Managing 1 inventory items worth ₹19,000
💰 Generated ₹1,500 from 1 sales
📊 Average transaction value: ₹1,500
💸 Total expenses: ₹50 across 1 categories
✅ Current profit: ₹1,450
```

**With OpenAI ($5 credits):**
```
Your business is performing well! Here's what I noticed:

1. Strong profit margin (96.7%) on your smartphone sales
2. Your inventory turnover is healthy - sold 5% of stock
3. Marketing expense (₹50) is only 3.3% of revenue, which is excellent

Recommendations:
- Monitor your remaining 95 units for optimal reorder point
- Track which payment methods customers prefer
- Consider bundling products for higher average transaction value

Your net profit of ₹1,450 shows healthy business operations!
```

### **Test 3: Check AI Status**

API call (or create a status button in UI):

```javascript
const status = await aiAPIAdvanced.getStatus();
console.log(status);
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "services": {
      "openai": {
        "configured": true,
        "features": ["Chat", "Business Analysis", "Image Generation"]
      },
      "elevenlabs": { "configured": false },
      "deepgram": { "configured": false },
      "imageGeneration": { "configured": false }
    },
    "note": "AI features fully enabled"
  }
}
```

### **Test 4: Image Generation (Requires API key)**

Type in AI chat:
```
"A modern smartphone product photo"
```

Click the purple **Image** button.

**With OpenAI/Stability:**
- Generates professional image
- Returns base64 or URL
- Displays in chat

**Without API key:**
- Shows error message
- Provides setup instructions

## 🔧 API Integration Status

### **✅ Fully Implemented:**
- OpenAI Chat Completions (GPT-3.5/4)
- OpenAI Function Calling (Business Analysis)
- OpenAI DALL·E 3 (Image Generation)
- Stability AI SDXL (Alternative Images)
- ElevenLabs Text-to-Speech
- Deepgram Speech-to-Text
- Fallback system (works without APIs)

### **📋 How It Works:**

```
User Input
    ↓
Frontend (React)
    ↓
Backend API (/api/ai/chat)
    ↓
Check if OpenAI configured?
    ↓
YES → Use OpenAI for smart response
    ↓
NO → Use fallback (keyword matching + business data)
    ↓
Return response to frontend
    ↓
Display to user
```

**The system gracefully degrades** - if APIs aren't configured, it still works!

## 📝 Update Frontend (Optional Enhancement)

To use the advanced AI features in frontend, update `frontend/src/services/api.js`:

```javascript
// Add this after your existing API exports
export const aiAPIAdvanced = {
  getStatus: async () => {
    const response = await apiClient.get('/ai/status');
    return response.data;
  },

  chat: async (message, context) => {
    const response = await apiClient.post('/ai/chat', { message, context });
    return response.data;
  },

  getInsights: async () => {
    const response = await apiClient.get('/ai/insights');
    return response.data;
  },

  generateImage: async (prompt, style = 'photographic') => {
    const response = await apiClient.post('/ai/generate-image', { prompt, style });
    return response.data;
  },

  textToSpeech: async (text, voiceId) => {
    const response = await apiClient.post('/ai/text-to-speech', { text, voiceId });
    return response.data;
  }
};
```

Then in `Ai.jsx`, replace `aiAPI` with `aiAPIAdvanced`.
