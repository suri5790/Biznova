## 🔍 What's EXCLUDED (Internal Metrics)

The invoice PDF **does NOT include:**
- ❌ Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)
- ❌ Gross Profit
- ❌ Profit Margin
- ❌ Revenue calculations
- ❌ Internal IDs (shows friendly invoice number)

**Why?** 
These are business-internal metrics. Customers don't need to see your profit margins or costs. They only need:
- What they bought
- How much they paid
- Receipt for their records
